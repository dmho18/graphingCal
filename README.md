# graphingCal

## About the Project
This project was written in C++ and SFML was used to create a simple user interface.

## Why SFML?
Pros: It is fairly easy to implement and lightweight. This was done in my first year of learning to code so I wasn't aware of other many frameworks. <br/>
Cons: Very minimal, it does not have text-highlighter or text-input field so one has to create themselves or work their ways around it.
